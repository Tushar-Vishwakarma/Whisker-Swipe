# Whisker-Swipe üêæ

Whisker-Swipe is a fun and innovative dating app designed exclusively for cats! Cats can now swipe right for their perfect match based on shared interests, favorite treats, and purring styles. Whether it's a lazy napper or an energetic playmate, Whisker-Swipe helps your feline friends find their purrfect match.

Features
1. Cat Profiles: The app displays cat profiles with their name, age, breed, and a placeholder image.
2. Swiping Functionality: Users can swipe left or right on cat profiles using the buttons below the card.
3. Animations: The component uses Framer Motion to add smooth transitions when swiping between profiles.
4. Match Notification: When a user swipes right on a profile, a match notification appears with an option to "Send a meow".
5. Playful Design: The app features a gradient background and cat-themed elements to make it fun and engaging.


To use this component, you would need to:
1. Install necessary dependencies: `framer-motion` and `lucide-react`.
2. Set up shadcn/ui components in your project.
3. Replace the placeholder images with actual cat images.
4. Implement backend logic for real user profiles and matching functionality.


This component provides a solid foundation for a cat dating app, which you can further expand by adding features like user authentication, profile creation, and real-time messaging between matched cats (or their owners).

Future Enhancements
- Video Calls for Cats: Allow cats to have face-to-face time with their new friends.
- Treat Sharing: Order and send treats directly from the app.
- More Pets: Expanding the platform to include dogs, rabbits, and other pets.
